                            ><em>Sèr</em> or <em>Cerq</em>, French:
                            <em>Sercq</em>) is an island in the southwestern
                            English Channel, off the coast of Normandy, and part
                            of the archipelago of the Channel Islands. It is
                            part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, a self-governing
                            British Crown Dependency, with its own set of laws
                            based on Norman law, and its own parliament.[5] It
                            was a royal fiefdom until 2008, when the
                            Constitution of Sark went into effect.

                            Sark has a population of about 500.[6] Including the
                            nearby island of Brecqhou, it has an area of 2.10
                            square miles (5.44 km2).[7] Little Sark is a
                            peninsula joined by a natural but high and very
                            narrow isthmus to the rest of Sark Island.

                            Sark is one of the few places in the world where
                            cars are banned from roads, and only tractors,
                            bicycles, and horse-drawn vehicles are allowed.[8]
                            In 2011, Sark was designated as a Dark Sky Community
                            and the first Dark Sky Island in the world.[9]

                        <h2>Geography and geology</h2>
                        <p>
                            Sark consists of two main parts, Greater Sark,
                            located at about 49°25′N 2°22′W, and Little Sark to
                            the south. They are connected by a narrow isthmus
                            called La Coupée which is 300 feet (91 m) long and
                            has a drop of 330 feet (100 m) on each side.[10]
                            Protective railings were added in 1900; before then,
                            children would crawl across on their hands and knees
                            to avoid being blown over the edge. A narrow
                            concrete road covering the entirety of the isthmus
                            was built in 1945 by German prisoners of war under
                            the direction of the Royal Engineers. Due to its
                            isolation, the inhabitants of Little Sark had their
                            distinct form of Sercquiais, the native Norman
                            dialect of the island.[11]
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The highest point on Sark is 374 feet (114 m) above
                            sea level.[10] A windmill, dated 1571, is found
                            there, the sails of which were removed during World
                            War II. This high point is named Le Moulin, after
                            the windmill. The location is also the highest point
                            in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. Little Sark had a
                            number of mines accessing a source of galena.[12] At
                            Port Gorey, the ruins of silver mines[13] may be
                            seen. Off the south end of Little Sark are the Venus
                            Pool and the Adonis Pool, both natural swimming
                            pools whose waters are refreshed at high tide.

                        <p>
                            The whole island is extensively penetrated at sea
                            level by natural cave formations that provide unique
                            habitats for many marine creatures, notably sea
                            anemones, some of which are only safely accessible
                            at low tide.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sark is made up mainly of amphibolite and granite
                            gneiss rocks, intruded by igneous magma sheets
                            called quartz diorite. Recent (1990–2000)[14]
                            geological studies and rock age-dating by geologists
                            from Oxford Brookes University shows that the
                            gneisses probably formed around 620–600 million
                            years ago during the Late Pre-Cambrian Age Cadomian
                            Orogeny. The quartz diorite sheets were intruded
                            during this Cadomian deformation and metamorphic
                            event.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All the Sark rocks (and those of the nearby Channel
                            Islands of Guernsey and Alderney) formed during
                            geological activity in the continental crust above
                            an ancient subduction zone. This geological setting
                            would have been analogous to the modern-day
                            subduction zone of the Pacific Ocean plate colliding
                            and subducting beneath the North and South American
                            continental plate.

                            Sark also exercises jurisdiction over the island of
                            Brecqhou, only a few hundred feet west of Greater
                            Sark. It is a private island, but it has recently
                            been opened to some visitors. From 1993 Brecqhou was
                            owned by the brothers David and Frederick Barclay,
                            until David Barclay died in 2021 and Frederick
                            Barclay became sole owner. The brothers contested
                            Sark's control over the island. The candidates
                            endorsed by their various business interests on the
                            island failed to win any seats in the elections held
                            in 2008[15] and 2010.[16]

                        <h3>Old records</h3>
                        <p>
                            <em>Sark</em> is probably first mentioned in the
                            Antonine Itinerary (Itinerarium Antonini Augusti,
                            part II: itinerarium maritimum) 3rd – 4th century AD
                            together with the other main Channel Islands as
                            Sarnia, Caesarea, Barsa, Silia and Andium, but it is
                            unclear to which it refers. It has been suggested
                            that Silia referred to Sark.[17]: 131–132  The
                            earliest record to evoke possibly the name of Sark
                            are the Life of Saint Samson and the Life of Saint
                            Magloire, bishops of Dol-de-Bretagne. They spell it
                            Sargia,[18] with the neighbouring island
                            Bissargia,[18]: 41  all the other documents are from
                            the 11th to the 12th century and the forms are:
                            Serc, Serch, Sercum, Serco.[17]: 124

                        <h3>Etymology</h3>
                        <p>
                            Richard Coates has suggested that in the absence of
                            a Proto-Indo-European etymology it may be worthwhile
                            looking for a Proto-Semitic source for the
                            name.[19][20] He proposes a comparison between the
                            probable root of Sark, *Sarg-, and Proto-Semitic
                            *śrq "redden; rise (as of the sun); east", noting
                            Sark's position as the easternmost island of the
                            Guernsey group.[21] His theory is based on the early
                            medieval Latin records mentioning Sargia, but many
                            Islands more or less close to Sark have a Latin name
                            ending with -gia, such as Angia (Channel Island),
                            Oye-Plage (Pas-de-Calais, Ogia 8th century) and
                            Île-d'Yeu (Vendée, former Augia). Later records all
                            mention Serc- and not *Sark, that seem to result
                            from a later anglicising of the /er/ group (compare
                            French merveille > English marvel; French Clerc /
                            English clerk, clark cf. Clark). The traditional
                            pronunciation of Sark in the native Norman language
                            is sèr [sɛr], with regular fall of final [k] like
                            clerc in French.[17]: 124  Finally, no specialist
                            ever identified any Proto-Semitic element in the
                            French coastal toponymy, even on the French
                            mediterranean side. René Lepelley suggests a
                            Scandinavian etymology that would explain the
                            regular and late records of the root Serc- in the
                            documents, according to him, it could be Old Norse
                            serkr "shirt".[17]: 124  He compares with the name
                            given to an island or a mountain by Vikings sailing
                            from Norway to Greenland: Hvítserkr cf. Hvitserk,
                            maybe Mount Forel,[17]: 124  so Old Saxon *Serki or
                            Old Norse Serkr > Serc could have been a descriptive
                            landmark for Saxon or Scandinavian sailors. In
                            addition Norman toponymy reveals a mixture of
                            (Anglo-)Saxon and Old Norse (Old Danish) place name
                            elements. The Old English form of sark "shirt"
                            (related to Old Norse serkr) is precisely serċ, syrċ
                            > Middle English serk, serke, sark (through the
                            Anglian variant).
